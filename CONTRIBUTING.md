# Contributing to url-shortener

To contribute to the repo create an issue (so you can be assigned), fork the repo, create your feature and submit a pull request.
Below are some ideas for areas that need improving.

Let's make a great url-shortener. Current version is working, but certainly not optimal (especially in the front-end)

In the spirit of hacktoberfest, help wanted in:
 - securing api (preventing server overload and malicious links)
 - front-end (it's very bare-bones at the moment)
 - documentation (guide for deployments)
 - faster / more reliable database implementations. Currently working with redis only.
 - Deployments for various hosting services (k8s, heroku, etc.). docker-compose is supported at the moment. k8s is untested.
 - any bugs you might find (the codebase was originally written as a 1 hour challenge)
